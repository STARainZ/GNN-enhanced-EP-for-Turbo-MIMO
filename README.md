# GNN-enhanced-EP-for-Turbo-MIMO

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the graph neural network (GNN)-enhanced expectation propagation (EP) for MIMO turbo receivers [1], which extends the GNN-enhanced EP detector [2] into iterative detection and decoding (IDD). 

## Requirements
codes coming soon

## Steps to start
